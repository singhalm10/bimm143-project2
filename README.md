### Scientific Question:
How has PTPN5--a marker gene for the CA2 hippocampus region--been evolutionarily conserved between mice, humans, and the common marmoset?

### Hypothesis:
If sequence alignment reveals differences between mice, humans, and the common marmoset for the PTPN5 marker gene of the CA2 hippocampus region, then homology modeling and sequence logos of this PTPN5 protein will further elucidate evolutionary relationships between the three species.
